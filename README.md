# Interpolation
## Assignement 1 for numerical Computing C/C++  
Use Lagrange interpolation to interpolate the following functions:

Test your generated polynomial with different orders, n= 5, 10, 20 and compute the
interpolation polynomial P n (x) at 41 regularly spaced points.
For each value of x k the Lagrange polynomial approximation is output together with
the exact /true value from the math library, also output the absolute error.
